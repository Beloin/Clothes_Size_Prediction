# Colther size predctions 
Clother Size predctions using dataset get from Kaggle

As we can see in the ML study. Unfortunelly we couldn't make a good predctin machine. This could be related to some things, like:

 - Bad Machine Learning implementation
 - Bad data usage
 - The data itself is bad. (WDYM?) This dataset lacks of context, first in example we cannot know if it's men's or women's clothing (or both),
 we cannot know which state, or place this dataset was obtained, what make predictions even more unrealieble.
 - This dataset could be randomly generated.
